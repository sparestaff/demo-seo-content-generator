          Custom content #21 | Hard-drive in my good `ol faithful HP died,
          Safemode Computer Service (SCS) was recommended to me by another
          repair company that were unable to assist me. SCS were extremely
          helpful and able to schedule in immediately. They provided
          comprehensive quote upfront and completed the job ahead of schedule.
          Very happy with the service they provided.
